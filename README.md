# Web-scraping

The goal of this project is to create an automated news aggregator that fetches and displays real-time news articles from Economic Times based on user-specified topics like industry, politics, and more. The project will utilize the Newspaper3k Python module for web scraping and a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance user interaction.

Key Features:

Web Scraping with Newspaper3k:

Utilize the Newspaper3k module to scrape news articles from the Economic Times website.
Extract relevant information such as headlines, publication date, and article content.
User-Interactive GUI:

Develop a graphical user interface using a Python GUI library like Tkinter or PyQt.
Include input fields for users to enter their preferred news topics (e.g., industry, politics, finance).
Implement a button to trigger the news fetching process.
Automatic News Updates:

Set up an automatic update mechanism to refresh news content periodically.
Display the latest news articles each time the user enters a news topic or triggers a manual update.
Potential Challenges:

Handling dynamic content and potential changes in the website's structure.
Ensuring ethical web scraping practices and compliance with the website's terms of service.
Providing a seamless user experience with quick response times for news retrieval.
